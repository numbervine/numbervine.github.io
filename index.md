## Welcome to my GitHub Page

If it strikes you as being rather empty, you're spot on :)

I've just about started packaging and publishing my code. Got a bunch of JS and PHP modules in the works which should be out there in a month or so, hoping all goes well. I finally got to it after more than decade of procrastination! Pink Floyd articulated this perfectly - "And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.. . No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun"
